## <span style="color:#268BD2">Section 1: **data analysis**</span>

In the first section you are going to find a space for the <span style="color:#df691a">**data analysis**</span>. In the first place you are going to find the elements needed to make the configuration of the data. Below the app supports 3 features:
1. <span style="color:#B3E2FF">**Exploratory Data Analysis:**</span> Here you will find a simple description of the data, nothing complicated.
2. <span style="color:#B3E2FF">**Graphs and Histograms Open/Close:**</span> This feature creates you 5 differents graph of your data giving you the histograms, the candlestick graph and the time series plot, here I have used different tools to build the graphs.
3. <span style="color:#B3E2FF">**Create the Model:**</span> It supports the creation of an <span style="color:#df691a">**Auto-Arima R Model**</span>, at first you can validate if the conditions of the model are verified. Then you can click the bottom "Shall Auto-Arima Model?" to generate it, check the validation with graphs and p-values, and see the prediction.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
	<b>Important:</b> For upload your own data, them should have the next columns at the same order: Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Adj Close,Volume <br> If you want to load the data in this format you can use [Yahoo Finance](https://es.finance.yahoo.com/), search the values you want and you donwload them from <span style="color:#df691a"><b>Historical Data</b></span>
</div>

## <span style="color:#268BD2">Section 2: **Today's Winners, GDP, Locations**</span>

Here the app supports 3 features again:
1. The upside table represents the <span style="color:#df691a">**10 Winner Companies**</span> of today. It can modify its value depending on the hour you open the app because the market could be open.
2. An interactive graph that covers the <span style="color:#df691a">**GDP Growth per Country**</span> and compares them with colors.
3. An interactive graph where you can write an latitude and a longitude to find a company office for example. The default value represents the Inditex office location.

## <span style="color:#268BD2">Section 3: **Documentation**</span>
In this section I describe the main idea of the application and the different references and examples that I have used to build it.
